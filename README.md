# Quantum Swap Modelling for Adaptive Traffic Signalling in Intelligent Transportation
# 🧠 Quantum vs Classical Clustering for Traffic Signal Control

This project compares classical and quantum clustering-based methods for adaptive traffic signal control. We simulate a 4-way intersection using `pygame`, analyzing vehicle wait times and throughput, while dynamically adapting green light durations.

## 🚦 Project Overview

We simulate real-time traffic control using:

- **Classical KMeans clustering** (in `normal_clustering_submit.py`)
- **Quantum clustering** using swap test or similar strategies (in `quantum_clustering_submit.py`)

These algorithms adjust traffic light durations based on real-time vehicle densities and positions.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run

> Make sure all dependencies are installed and the images are correctly placed.

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install pygame scikit-learn matplotlib
```

For quantum clustering:

```bash
pip install qiskit
```

### 2. Run Classical Clustering Simulation

```bash
python normal_clustering_submit.py
```

### 3. Run Quantum Clustering Simulation

```bash
python quantum_clustering_submit.py
```

### 4. Visualize Results

```bash
python normal_clustering_results.py
python quantum_clustering_results.py
```

## 📊 Sample Output Metrics

- **Throughput**: Number of vehicles that crossed the signal
- **Average Wait Time**: Per vehicle in seconds
- Output appears every 10 seconds in the terminal
- Visualization graphs in results scripts

## ⚛️ Quantum Details

The quantum clustering implementation uses:

- **Cosine similarity** between vehicle positions
- **Swap test (optional in backend)** to compute overlaps
- **KMeans-like clustering** based on quantum metrics

> This is a hybrid approach to test the viability of quantum representations in dynamic systems.

## 📌 TODO

- [ ] Replace simulated quantum similarity with actual Qiskit swap test circuit
- [ ] Integrate QML models for signal prediction
- [ ] Add benchmark graphs comparing classical vs quantum performance

## 📷 Image Assets

All images used for vehicles and intersection simulation are in the `images/` folder, with the following subfolders:

- `right/`, `left/`, `up/`, `down/` – directional vehicle sprites
- `signals/` – red, green, yellow light icons
- `intersection.png` – main background image

Ensure correct file names and dimensions for smooth simulation.
